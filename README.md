# Password Generator with JavaScript

## About The Project

This is exactly what is says. With Javacript you can create this password generator, that takes in the required fields and outputs a random password that you can also copy to clipboard.
You can check the boxes needed and the length of the password and with a click of a button a new password will be generated.
You can use this to learn the methods, apply it to your personal use or your projects.
